* evolved independently 40 to 65 times
* basic sense of direction and intensity of light
* No discernment

# The Route ~~Less~~ Most Traveled

## Approaches

* ** overloaded update method**
* copypasta
* restful copypasta
* inheritance
* including modules
* dependency injection

---

.fullscreen.center[![Pit Eyes](images/Land_Planarian.jpg)]

???

* "cup" eyespots or pit eyes
* curved like a cup or dip in the surface
* light from more than one direction can slightly distinguish light

## Approaches

* overloaded update method
* copypasta
* restful copypasta
* ** inheritance**
* including modules
* dependency injection

???

* Template pattern - where the parent calls the child
* NotImplementedError
* Inheritance Problems

** The highlander problem - There can be only one
** A controller that isn't useful by itself. Must have a child
** That's another talk

# Security Concerns

What?

???

* injection of params

* Water is the likely reason we see limited colors
* Water only allows blue and green light through
